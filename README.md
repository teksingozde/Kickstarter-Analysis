# Overview of Project
# Purpose
Louise is a future-proof playwright who started a crowdfunding campaign to finance her play. The campaign has approached its goal of fundraising in a very short time. Louise's expectation from us is that we analyze the performances of campaigns similar to her own regarding the launch dates and financing targets and ensure that they come to life in her eyes. In this project, we analyzed data on crowdfunding campaigns from 2009 to 2017.
