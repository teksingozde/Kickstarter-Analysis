# Overview of Project
Louise is a future-proof playwright who started a crowdfunding campaign to finance her play. The campaign has approached its goal of fundraising in a very short time. Louise's expectation from us is that we analyze the performances of campaigns similar to her own regarding the launch dates and financing targets and ensure that they come to life in her eyes. In this project, we analyzed data on crowdfunding campaigns from 2009 to 2017.

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to examine if there are differentiators that can make a project campaign successful, if so, what is going on and especially filtering them on the basis of games. In our analysis, we try to help with whether there is a link between successful campaigns and their launch dates and goals. With this analysis, we aim to show Louise how her campaign is performing compared to other similar campaigns.
